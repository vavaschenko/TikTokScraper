# TikTokScraper
Scrape comments from an array of TikTok videos with Selenium ChromeDriver
Note: this specific code only works for Chrome
Also bear in mind that the number of retrieved comments may differ from the number specified on the video page as TikTok does not lower the count to account for deleted comments

**TikTokScraper** is a notebook containing step by step download of all comments under a TikTok video
**commentData** is a service file for retrieval of data from the TikTok web-page
